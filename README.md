## About The Project

This project was made with the purpose of learning how to use Laravel.

The students of business BTS at Lycée Léonard de Vinci in Melun had to create a pop-up store to sell beekeeping products.

I was in charge of the website, so I decided to use Laravel to learn how to use it.

### Built With

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
